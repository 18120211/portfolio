## 📌 Overview  

Upgrading an **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster** can be challenging, especially when aiming to **avoid or minimize downtime** for applications. A traditional in-place upgrade of worker nodes can lead to disruptions, as workloads need to be drained and rescheduled.  

This portfolio outlines a **safe and reliable upgrade strategy** by:  
1. **Upgrading the control plane first** to ensure compatibility with new Kubernetes features.  
2. **Creating a new worker node pool** instead of upgrading existing nodes, preventing disruptions.  
3. **Using a Blue-Green deployment approach** to gradually migrate workloads from the old node pool to the new version.  
4. **Repeating the process until all workloads are migrated**, followed by **post-upgrade checks and verification**.  

By following this method, the upgrade is performed **gradually and with minimal impact** on running applications, ensuring high availability and reliability.

## 🔑 Key Concepts  

### 1️⃣ **Kubernetes Control Plane Upgrade**  
The **control plane** is responsible for managing the cluster, including scheduling, scaling, and networking. Upgrading it first ensures compatibility with the newer worker nodes before workloads are moved.  

### 2️⃣ **Node Pools & Rolling Upgrades**  
Instead of **upgrading existing nodes**, we create a **new node pool** running the upgraded Kubernetes version. This prevents disruptions since old nodes remain operational while new nodes are provisioned.  

### 3️⃣ **Blue-Green Deployment Strategy**  
A **Blue-Green deployment** is used to **gradually shift workloads** from the **old node pool (Blue)** to the **new node pool (Green)**, ensuring:  
- **Zero downtime** by keeping both pools active during the transition.  
- **Rollback capability** if issues arise in the new node pool.  

### 4️⃣ **Workload Migration**  
- Applications are **moved incrementally** from the old node pool to the new node pool.  
- Traffic is **gradually shifted** to new nodes via **load balancing and pod rescheduling**.  

### 5️⃣ **Post-Upgrade Verification**  
After the migration is complete, we perform **checks to validate**:  
✅ Application availability and performance.  
✅ Logs and monitoring metrics for anomalies.  
✅ Node and cluster health status.  

By **systematically upgrading AKS clusters** in this way, we achieve a **smooth transition with minimal risk and downtime**. 🚀

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  

The following technologies and tools are leveraged in this **zero-downtime AKS upgrade strategy**:  

### **🔹 Kubernetes & AKS Services**  
- **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)** – Managed Kubernetes cluster hosting workloads.  
- **Kubernetes Control Plane** – Handles scheduling, scaling, and networking.  
- **Node Pools** – Separate node groups supporting different Kubernetes versions.  
- **Kubernetes Services & Ingress** – Manage traffic routing during migration.  

### **🔹 Infrastructure as Code & Automation**  
- **Terraform** – Manages AKS infrastructure, including node pools and networking.  
- **Azure DevOps Pipelines** – Automates control plane upgrades and node pool provisioning.  
- **Helm** – Deploys and manages Kubernetes applications efficiently.  

### **🔹 Load Balancing & Traffic Routing**  
- **Azure Load Balancer** – Distributes traffic between node pools during migration.  
- **Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)** – Ensures proper scaling of workloads.  
- **NGINX Ingress Controller** – Manages HTTP traffic routing for services.  

### **🔹 Monitoring & Logging**  
- **Azure Monitor for Containers** – Tracks cluster health, performance, and logs.  
- **Prometheus & Grafana** – Provides real-time observability into Kubernetes workloads.  
- **Fluentd / Azure Log Analytics** – Aggregates and analyzes logs for debugging issues.  

📌 **This technology stack ensures a reliable, automated, and efficient Kubernetes upgrade process with minimal service disruption.** 🚀
